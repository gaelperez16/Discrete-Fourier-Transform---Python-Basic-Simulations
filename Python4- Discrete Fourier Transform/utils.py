    # 1. What is the DFT and what is its purpose?
    """
    The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is a mathematical tool used to convert a
    signal from the time domain into the frequency domain, enabling analysis of the
    different frequency components present in a discrete-time signal.
    """


    # 2. How does the DFT transform a discrete time-domain signal into the discrete frequency domain?
    """
   The DFT achieves this transformation by taking a weighted sum 
    of the signalâ€™s samples, where each sample is multiplied by a complex exponential.
    This process isolates individual frequency components within the signal.
    """



    # 3. What is the mathematical formula for calculating the DFT of a signal?
    """
    The DFT is calculated using the formula: X[k] = sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] * exp(-2j * pi * k * n / N) 
    where each X[k] represents a frequency component of the signal.
    """

    # 4. Discuss any limitations or challenges associated with using the DFT, especially when dealing with large datasets.
    """
  The DFT has a computational complexity of O(N^2), meaning it requires significant
  processing power for large datasets. Additionally, it can introduce artifacts or aliasing issues
  when applied to non-periodic signals.
    """

    # 5.What is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and how does it differ from the DFT?
    """
   The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an optimized algorithm for calculating the DFT. By leveraging a
   divide-and-conquer approach, the FFT dramatically reduces the number of calculations needed,
   making it much faster than directly computing the DFT.
    """

    # 6. Explain how the FFT achieves a significant reduction in computational complexity.
    """
    The FFT lowers the computational complexity from O(N^2) in the DFT to O(NlogN). 
    This efficiency improvement enables practical use of Fourier analysis on large datasets by minimizing
    the required computational resources.
